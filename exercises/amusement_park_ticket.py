def compute_price(age: int, base_price: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate ticket prices based on age for an amusement park.

    This function should:
    - Take a person's age and the base ticket price
    - Apply age-based pricing rules:
      * Children under 12 get free admission (0.0)
      * Seniors over 65 get free admission (0.0)
      * Everyone else pays the full base price
    - Return the final price to pay

    Think about: How do you check if a number is within a range? What conditional logic do you need?
    This involves age-based conditional logic and comparison operations.
