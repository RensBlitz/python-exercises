    Count how many times each vowel appears in a sentence.

    This function should:
    - Identify all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input sentence
    - Count occurrences of each vowel
    - Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters (case-insensitive)
    - Return the results in a map with vowels as keys and counts as values

    Think about: How do you identify vowels? How do you handle case differences?
    What data structure would be best for storing vowel counts?
