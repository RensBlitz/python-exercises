    Calculate the exact volumes of magical ingredients needed for a potion.

    This exercise involves percentage calculations and working with arrays.
    You'll determine the precise amounts of three magical ingredients based on their proportions.

    This function should:
    - Take the total vial volume in milliliters
    - Calculate the volume of each ingredient based on their percentages:
      * 30% dragon blood
      * 50% unicorn tears
      * 20% stardust
    - Return the volumes in a list in the specified order: [dragon blood, unicorn tears, stardust]

    Think about: How do you calculate percentages? How do you convert percentages to actual volumes?
    What data structure should you use to return multiple values?
