def join(items: list[str]) -> str:
    """
    Join a list of shopping items into a single string.

    This function should:
    - Take a list of item names
    - Combine them into one string
    - Separate items with commas and spaces (", ")
    - Return the formatted shopping list

    Think about: How do you combine multiple strings? What separator should you use?
    How do you handle an empty list or a list with only one item?
