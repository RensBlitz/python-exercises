def spread_and_average(high: float, low: float) -> List[float]:
    """
    Calculate both the difference between high and low temperatures and their average.

    This exercise tests your ability to work with arrays and multiple calculations.
    You'll need to perform two different calculations and return them in a specific format.

    This function should:
    - Take high and low temperature values
    - Calculate the difference (high - low)
    - Calculate the average ((high + low) / 2)
    - Return both values in a specific list format:
      * [0] = difference (high - low)
      * [1] = average

    Think about: How do you calculate the difference between two numbers? How do you calculate an average?
    What data structure should you use to return multiple values? How do you work with lists?
