    Find the first available seat on a bus.

    This function should:
    - Take a list representing bus seats (False = available, True = occupied)
    - Scan through the seats to find the first available one
    - Return the index of the first free seat
    - Return -1 if the bus is full (no available seats)

    Think about: How do you scan through a list? How do you identify available vs occupied seats?
    What should you return when no seats are available?
